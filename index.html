         <div class="About-Me-Grid">
            <p class="About-Me-Text">Hi! I’m an 18-year-old senior at Vinal Technical High School, where I focus on learning Information Technology. Outside of school, I work in childcare, a role that I find meaningful because I enjoy nurturing and supporting young minds. I’m also developing my creative skills by practicing Photoshop, which I see as an important tool in today’s tech-driven world. I have a strong interest in joining the Army to become an aircraft mechanic, but I’m also considering the aviation program at Bristol Technical Education Center as an alternative path. I’m a hands-on learner who thrives when shown how to perform tasks and given the opportunity to repeat and master them. I’m excited for what lies ahead and ready to pursue a future that challenges and inspires me.

            <div class="About-Me-Grid2">
               <p class="About-Me-Text">Morality plays a crucial role in guiding my actions and decisions. I prioritize integrity in everything I do, whether it’s in my studies, my job, or my interactions with others. I believe that making ethical choices fosters trust and respect, both in personal relationships and within the broader community. By adhering to strong moral principles, I aim to set a positive example and inspire others to do the same, contributing to a more compassionate world.
<br></br>
               </p>
               <p class="About-Me-Text">Responsibility is a core principle that guides my actions in both my academic and personal life. Balancing my studies, my job in childcare, and planning for my future requires careful time management and commitment. I take pride in being dependable and ensuring that I meet my obligations, whether it’s completing assignments on time or being a positive role model for the children I work with. By embracing responsibility, I aim to set a strong example for my peers and contribute meaningfully to my community.
<br></br>
               </p>
               <p class="About-Me-Text Disapere">Humility is a value that I strive to embody in all aspects of my life. I believe that recognizing my strengths and weaknesses allows me to grow and learn from others. In my role on the student council, I appreciate the diverse perspectives my peers bring to the table, and I remain open to feedback and new ideas. By practicing humility, I aim to create a collaborative atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and contributing to our collective success. Ultimately, I see humility as a strength that fosters connection and encourages continuous personal development. <br></br>

         <div class="About-Me-Grid3">
            <p class="About-Me-Text">My goal is to become an aircraft mechanic, ideally through military service where I can receive hands-on training and develop real-world skills. I’m someone who learns best by doing—watching, practicing, and repeating until I truly understand. If the Army path doesn’t work out, I plan to attend the aviation program at Bristol Technical Education Center to continue pursuing this dream. I’m motivated by the opportunity to work in a field that combines technology, mechanics, and continuous learning.
