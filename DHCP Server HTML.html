          I was learning how to set up and manage a DHCP (Dynamic Host
          Configuration Protocol) server in a virtualized environment. I was
          exploring how DHCP assigns IP addresses to client machines by
          reviewing the DHCP management console, where they could see an
          assigned lease for a client device. Additionally, I checked the
          network connection details of another machine, which showed an APIPA
          (169.254.x.x) address, indicating that the client had failed to obtain
          an IP from the DHCP server. This suggests I was troubleshooting
          connectivity issues, possibly ensuring that the DHCP server (running
          on a machine named BOBBY with IP 10.1.1.5) was correctly configured
          and reachable. Through this process, I was gaining hands-on experience
          with DHCP lease assignments, network troubleshooting, and server
          management.
