          I was in the process of setting up and configuring a domain
          environment, ensuring that network services function correctly. In the
          first screenshot, I was managing a DHCP server on a machine named
          BOBBY, verifying that it was assigning IP addresses dynamically, with
          at least one client (DESKTOP-OJNAHEV) receiving an IP lease. This is
          essential for networked devices to communicate efficiently. In the
          second screenshot, I was working within Active Directory Users and
          Computers (ADUC) under the domain Elizabeth.net, where I had
          successfully added DESKTOP-OJNAHEV as a computer object. This step
          indicates that the device was joined to the domain, enabling
          centralized authentication and management. Overall, I was establishing
          a functional domain environment, ensuring devices could communicate
          and be managed within the network.
