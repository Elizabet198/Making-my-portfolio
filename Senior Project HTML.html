          For my senior project, I created a personal portfolio website from
          scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and certifications as a
          student at a technical high school. I designed and coded the entire
          site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on clean
          structure, responsive design, and user-friendly navigation. I
          organized the project using separate files for each section—such as
          hobbies, certifications, and projects—to maintain clarity and
          scalability. The site features modern design elements like Google
          Fonts, Ionicons for icons, animated background effects, and a
          responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I also used
          GitHub Pages to publish the site, allowing it to be live and
          accessible online. This project demonstrates not only my technical
          knowledge in web development but also my ability to manage a full
          project from planning to deployment.

          For this project, I built a VEX EXP Speed Bot robot, focusing on
          creating a high-performance design optimized for speed. The challenge
          was to develop a robot that could quickly and efficiently complete
          tasks while maintaining precision and stability. I used the VEX EXP
          system to construct the robot, integrating various components such as
          motors, sensors, and structural parts to maximize its performance.
          Through rigorous testing and iteration, I fine-tuned the robot’s speed
          and handling to meet the project’s requirements. This hands-on
          experience enhanced my understanding of robotics, engineering
          principles, and problem-solving strategies.

          For my Skills USA competition, I created a custom pin design that
          highlighted the essence of Connecticut. My first design incorporated
          blue tones to symbolize the state, with a robin and mountain laurel
          flowers representing local wildlife. However, I wanted to make the
          design more dynamic and engaging, so I reimagined it with a cartoon
          style, reflecting Connecticut's vibrant fall colors. The design
          features the state bird flying across the sky, framed within the
          outline of Connecticut, with a sign at the bottom to hang from the
          pin. <br />

          <br />I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to bring this vision to
          life, and I was honored to have my design reach both regional and
          national levels, though I did not progress further.

          For this project, I was tasked with creating a custom logo for my
          school’s Skills USA team, intended to be printed on t-shirts for
          competition. My goal was to develop a design that not only captured
          the spirit of Skills USA but also reflected the unique identity of our
          school. I started by brainstorming concepts that would be both
          visually striking and represent our team’s values of skill, teamwork,
          and determination. After refining my ideas, I created a bold and
          modern logo that would stand out on apparel while maintaining a
          professional yet energetic look. This project allowed me to enhance my
          graphic design skills and my ability to communicate a strong visual
          message.
