          I embarked on creating my first website by following an in-depth tutorial that took me over 30-40+ hours to complete. This extensive process helped me develop a strong understanding of HTML and CSS, which ignited my interest in web development and coding. The tutorial was based on the OMNI Foods website, and I took the opportunity to customize the layout and design to better suit my vision. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in web design, problem-solving, and learning how to manipulate code to achieve a desired aesthetic and functionality. It was a rewarding experience that sparked my passion for further exploring the world of web development.
